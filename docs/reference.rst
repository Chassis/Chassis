Troubleshooting
---------------

There is a known bug in Vagrant 1.8.5 which will result in the following output:

::

  Vagrant attempted to execute the capability 'change_host_name'
  on the detect guest OS 'linux', but the guest doesn't
  support that capability. This capability is required for your
  configuration of Vagrant. Please either reconfigure Vagrant to
  avoid this capability or fix the issue by creating the capability.
To correct this you can either follow this fix on `stackoverflow`_ or rollback to Vagrant 1.8.4 until 1.8.6 is released.
