Building a new Base Box for Vagrant Cloud
-----------------------------------------

The `Chassis base boxes`_ are generated by the Chassis team and they are uploaded to Vagrant Cloud.

The Chassis base box will follow the `SEM Versioning 2.0.0`_ specification which is ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``.
For example:

1. MAJOR version 2.0.0 - This would be a new Ubuntu distrobution. e.g. Bionic Beaver.
2. MINOR version 1.1.0 - This would be when we have added a new Chassis feature. e.g. `upload_size`
3. PATCH version 1.0.1 - This would be when the Ubuntu base box has had an update.

To generate and upload a new base box a Vagrant Cloud Chassis team member will need to do the following:

1. Open a new issue in the Chassis repository with details about the base box updates.
2. Create a new branch off `master` for the base box updates.
3. Bump the `version number`_ of the base box.
4. Run ``sh buildbox.sh`` in the root directory of Chassis.
5. Login to your Vagrant Cloud account when you are prompted to do so.
6. Wait for the upload to complete.
7. Submit a Pull Request and wait for one of the Chassis team members to approve it.

Troubleshooting
---------------

There is a known bug in Vagrant 1.8.5 which will result in the following output:

::

  Vagrant attempted to execute the capability 'change_host_name'
  on the detect guest OS 'linux', but the guest doesn't
  support that capability. This capability is required for your
  configuration of Vagrant. Please either reconfigure Vagrant to
  avoid this capability or fix the issue by creating the capability.
  To correct this you can either follow this fix on `stackoverflow`_ or rollback to Vagrant 1.8.4 until 1.8.6 is released.

Character encoding on Windows machines
--------------------------------------

::

  $ vagrant up
  Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
  ==> default: Importing base box 'bento/ubuntu-16.04'...
  C:/Vagrant/embedded/gems/2.1.1/gems/childprocess-0.6.3/lib/childprocess/windows/process_builder.rb:43:in `join': incompatible character encodings: Windows-1252 and UTF-8 (Encoding::CompatibilityError)


To resolve this issue you'll need to create a symlink and set the VAGRANT_HOME path. e.g.

::

  $ cd C:\users
  $ mklink /J username usérnamé
  $ setx VAGRANT_HOME "C:/users/username"

Alternatively you can set the path for VirtualBox to a directory that doesn't have special characters. To do this open the VirtualBox application, select 'File' -> 'Settings' -> 'General' and change the default path for VM's (e.g. to "C:\VirtualBox VMs").
